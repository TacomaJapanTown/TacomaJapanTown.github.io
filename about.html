										<h2><a>Background</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Re-mapping Tacoma's Japantown is part of a broader research project at the University of Washington, Tacoma called the Japanese Language School project. The JLS project focuses on the language school that used to be in Tacoma. The school was closed during WWII when Japanese-Americans were taken to internment camps. In the 1990s UWT purchased the property and had an asessment completed to determine necessary repairs. The asessment showed the language school would need extensive repairs to become suitable as a campus building. Unfortunately, completing these repairs would impede the building from becoming a historically designated place. The building was demolished in the 1990s.
									</p>
									<p>
										In order to preserve the history of the language school, UWT asked its professors to condust research. Professors Dr. Lisa Hoffman and Dr. Mary Hanneman took on the project to learn about the school and its surrounding community. In the early 2000s they travelled the U.S. interviewing former students of the language school. These interviews formed the basis of a spatial analysis that I completed in 2018.

											<h3>This Project</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This project is the culmination of research I have been working on at UWT in 2018 and 2019 as a research assistant and graduate student. The purpose is to bring local Japanese-American history to light. Their history in Tacoma before WWII has been forgotten. I have collected spatial information from the Japanese Language School project interviews and written sources on the area. I combined all of the data and created mappable data. These datasets are what you see on the website.

											<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Japanese-American history has largely been forgotten, yet when it is remembered, the focus is on World War II incarceration. The field of Japanese-American history understandably focuses on this trauma, but surely there is more to their history. This project focuses on illuminating the elided history of their everyday lives and experiences through an exploration of the Japanese community in Tacoma, Washington. The two web-maps created by this project expand local understandings of how Japanese-Americans interacted with the city. This project also seeks to provide the public with ground-breaking knowledge on the spatial spread of Tacoma's Japantown, which was previously unrecognized.
